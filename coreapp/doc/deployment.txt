Initial Setup

* add your public key to staging and production servers:

  - ssh as 'deploy' user to staging and production
  - add your public key to .ssh/authorized_keys
  - add to your local .ssh/config
     Host outspokes.com
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/your_key
     User deploy

     Host whatcodecraves.com
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/your_key
     User deploy

Once your local changes are reviewed, tested, and pushed to master, do
the following to deploy to staging

    cap deploy

If that succeeds and you're *sure* it's ready to go into production, run:

    cap production deploy
