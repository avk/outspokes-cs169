%h3 General
%dl
  %dt What browsers are supported?
  %dd Outspokes is currently in alpha, so we're only testing functionality with Firefox 3.  While it may work on other browsers, we're not going to guarantee it'll work perfectly.  Also, there's really no point in using Outspokes if you don't have javascript enabled.
  %dt What is targeting?
  %dd Targeting is a way to attach your comment to a part of the page you are commenting on.  To target a part of the page, click on the "target" button in the widget while you are commenting, and then click on the part of the page you would like the comment to be attached to (an image, piece of text, etc.).

  %dt How do I view targeted comments?
  %dd To view the target of a comment, hover your mouse over the comment, and a box will appear around the target of the comment on the page.

%h3 Commenters
%dl

  %dd No.  Please think carefully before voting.  The weight of the world rests on your shoulders.

  %dt Can I leave a comment for a specific person (inivisible to everyone else)?
  %dd No.  Think wisely before leaving feedback.  Don't be a douche.

  %dt Can I edit my own comments?
  %dd No.  Think carefully before leaving feedback.  Don't be a hoser.

  %dt Can I delete my own comments?
  %dd No.  Think sagely before leaving feedback.  Don't be a dick.  See the pattern?

%h3 Admin
%dl
  %dt How do I delete my site?
  %dd To delete your site, log in to outspokes.com.  Once you have logged in, to delete the site, click on the delete link to the right of your site name.

  %dt How do I remove commenters?
  %dd To remove a commenter, log in to the admin widget on your site, and click on the link to the link to the admin panel.  Then click on the 'x' to the right of the commenter you wish to delete.

  %dt What happens when I remove a commenter?
  %dd All feedback that the commenter has left will be deleted.  This information includes feedback comments and (dis)agree votes. 

  %dt Can commenters see each other's comments?
  %dd All commenters can see all comments.

  %dt How can I delete a single page?
  %dd To delete a single page, open up the admin panel on the widget, and click on the "pages" tab at the top.  Then click on the x to the right of whichever page you want to delete.  This action will delete all the feedback on a page, and leave your site unaffected.

  %dt What happens when I delete a page?
  %dd All the feedback and associated information (agree/disagree votes and reply threads) gets deleted.  The page on your site is not directly affected.

  %dt What the hell is this "javascript include" thing?
  %dd The javascript include tag is the piece of code that allows us to run our widget on your site.  The include tag pulls in the javascript code from our site, which allows someone with a valid URL token to see the widget and give feedback to your site.

  %dt Where should I put the include?
  %dd We suggest putting it at the bottom of the body page in the site.

  %dt Can I use your site on my Facebook profile, Myspace profile, or twitter profile?
  %dd No, although this isn't a shortcoming on our end.  Sites like Facebook and Myspace sanitize the text that you give them to prevent people from running things on your page that you might not expect.  Please note, we will never run any malicious code on your site.

  %dt What's with this whole cross-site scripting business?
  %dd In order to transmit people's comments to our site, we transferring information across web domains, which is technically considered a no-no to web security groups.  However, we are not transmitting and will not transmit any information from your domain other than that pertaining to the comments that people are giving.

  %dt Can I agree/disagree with a comment?
  %dd No.  We feel that as the person requesting feedback, your opinion (in this respect), doesn't really factor in to the commenters' consensus opinion.  To get your opinion heard, simply reply to the comment.
